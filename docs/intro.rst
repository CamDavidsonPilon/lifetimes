Introduction
------------

Lifetimes can be used to analyze your users based on a few assumption:

1. Users interact with you when they are “alive”.
2. Users under study may “die” after some period of time.

I’ve quoted “alive” and “die” as these are the most abstract terms: feel
free to use your own definition of “alive” and “die” (they are used
similarly to “birth” and “death” in survival analysis). Whenever we have
individuals repeating occurrences, we can use Lifetimes to help
understand user behaviour.

Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this is too abstract, consider these applications:

-  Predicting how often a visitor will return to your website. (Alive =
   visiting. Die = decided the website wasn’t for them)
-  Understanding how frequently a patient may return to a hospital.
   (Alive = visiting. Die = maybe the patient moved to a new city, or
   became deceased.)
-  Predicting individuals who have churned from an app using only their
   usage history. (Alive = logins. Die = removed the app)
-  Predicting repeat purchases from a customer. (Alive = actively
   purchasing. Die = became disinterested with your product)
-  Predicting the lifetime value of your customers

Specific Application: Customer Lifetime Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As emphasized by P. Fader and B. Hardie, understanding and acting on
customer lifetime value (CLV) is the most important part of your
business’s sales efforts. `And (apparently) everyone is doing it
wrong <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guj2gVEEx4s>`__. *Lifetimes* is a
Python library to calculate CLV for you.

Installation
------------
