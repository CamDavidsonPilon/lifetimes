Changelog
=========

0.11.1
~~~~~~

-  bump the Pandas requirements to >= 0.24.0. This should have been done
   in 0.11.0
-  suppress some warnings from autograd.

.. _section-1:

0.11.0
~~~~~~

-  Move most models (all but Pareto) to autograd for automatic
   differentiation of their likelihood. This results in faster (at least
   3x) and more successful convergence, plus allows for some really
   exciting extensions (coming soon).
-  ``GammaGammaFitter``, ``BetaGeoFitter``, ``ModifiedBetaGeoFitter``
   and ``BetaGeoBetaBinomFitter`` have three new attributes:
   ``confidence_interval_``, ``variance_matrix_`` and
   ``standard_errors_``
-  ``params_`` on fitted models is not longer an OrderedDict, but a
   Pandas Series
-  ``GammaGammaFitter`` can accept a ``weights`` argument now.
-  ``customer_lifelime_value`` in ``GammaGamma`` now accepts a frequency
   argument.
-  fixed a bug that was causing ``ParetoNBDFitter`` to generate data
   incorrectly.

.. _section-2:

0.10.1
~~~~~~

-  performance improvements to ``generate_data.py`` for large datasets
   #195
-  performance improvements to ``summary_data_from_transaction_data``,
   thanks @MichaelSchreier
-  Previously, ``GammaGammaFitter`` would have an infinite mean when its
   ``q`` parameter was less than 1. This was possible for some datasets.
   In 0.10.1, a new argument is added to ``GammaGammaFitter`` to
   constrain that ``q`` is greater than 1. This can be done with
   ``q_constraint=True`` in the call to ``GammaGammaFitter.fit``. See
   issue #146. Thanks @vruvora
-  Stop support of scipy < 1.0.
-  Stop support of < Python 3.5.

.. _section-3:

0.10.0
~~~~~~

-  ``BetaGeoBetaBinomFitter.fit`` has replaced ``n_custs`` with the more
   appropriately named ``weights`` (to align with other statisical
   libraries). By default and if unspecified, ``weights`` is equal to an
   array of 1s.
-  The ``conditional_`` methods on ``BetaGeoBetaBinomFitter`` have been
   updated to handle exogenously provided recency, frequency and
   periods.
-  Performance improvements in ``BetaGeoBetaBinomFitter``. ``fit`` takes
   about 50% less time than previously.
-  ``BetaGeoFitter``, ``ParetoNBDFitter``, and ``ModifiedBetaGeoFitter``
   both have a new ``weights`` argument in their ``fit``. This can be
   used to reduce the size of the data (collapsing subjects with the
   same recency, frequency, T).

.. _section-4:

0.9.1
~~~~~

-  Added a data generation method, ``generate_new_data`` to
   ``BetaGeoBetaBinomFitter``. @zscore
-  Fixed a bug in ``summary_data_from_transaction_data`` that was
   casting values to ``int`` prematurely. This was solved by including a
   new param ``freq_multiplier`` to be used to scale the resulting
   durations. See #100 for the original issue. @aprotopopov
-  Performance and bug fixes in
   ``utils.expected_cumulative_transactions``. @aprotopopov
-  Fixed a bug in ``utils.calculate_alive_path`` that was causing a
   difference in values compared to ``summary_from_transaction_data``.
   @DaniGate

.. _section-5:

0.9.0
~~~~~

-  fixed many of the numpy warnings as the result of fitting
-  added optional ``initial_params`` to all models
-  Added ``conditional_probability_of_n_purchases_up_to_time`` to
   ``ParetoNBDFitter``
-  Fixed a bug in ``expected_cumulative_transactions`` and
   ``plot_cumulative_transactions``

.. _section-6:

0.8.1
~~~~~

-  adding new ``save_model`` and ``load_model`` functions to all
   fitters. This will save the model locally as a pickle file.
-  ``observation_period_end`` in ``summary_data_from_transaction_data``
   and ``calibration_and_holdout_data`` now defaults to the max date in
   the dataset, instead of current time.
-  improved stability of estimators.
-  improve Runtime warnings.
-  All fitters are now in a local file. This doesnâ€™t change the API
   however.
